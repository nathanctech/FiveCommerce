FiveCommerce
===================


SETUP
===================

Alter the SkuMapping table with the needed packages. Here is the example:

local SkuMapping = {
    ["pack1"] = { id=1, description="Vehicle Pack" },
    ["pack2"] = { id=2, description="Vehicle Pack2" }
}

["pack1"]: The name of the package you're selling. Should be one word only and is typed with the /buy command. Needs to be formatted as shown.
id: The id of the package from the Partner page in keymaster.
description: Short description of the package. This is currently not used. Actual description on the buy screen is set by keymaster.

USAGE
===================

To handle custom packages (for purchasing currency, for example) handle the event "Commerce:HandlePackage" and apply your logic.

Example using ACE permissions:

RegisterNetEvent("Commerce:HandlePackage")
AddEventHandler("Commerce:HandlePackage", function(package)
    if package_id == "pack1" then
        SetPlayerPermission(source, "vip2")
    elseif package_id == "pack2" then
        SetPlayerPermission(source, "vip4")
    end
end)

EXPORTS
==================

FiveCommerce exports "SetPlayerPermission" as a server function:

SetPlayerPermission(playerSrc, aceName)
- playerSrc: the player object
- aceName: the permission to assign.

When used, the script tracks permissions granted by the script and will remove them if the player drops later.
